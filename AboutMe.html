		<p>         Hello everyone, thanks for coming to this newbie's crappy website. It will get better as time goes on, unless I stop doing this, or die. Well anyways, I won't really say anything
		   about me, so yeah this is really awkward. You found this website that says about me, now you're just here reading this awkward text, about an awkward guy, ranting about how awkward this is.
		   Ok I'm back. Sorry for just leaving so suddenly</p>
